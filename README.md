# AgonLight_GPIO

## Background
The Agon board is a xx. It is intended to xx.
It features xx and allows opportunity for learning and experimentation.

## Introduction 

This repo is intended to provide some simple add on boards for gpio examples and experiments.
It is a work in progress and is open to contributions and ideas, within the stated aims and limitations of this project.
## Aims
* Provide a range of simple IO hardware to aid coding BBC BASIC.
* Similarily be useful for gaining a general understanding of GPIO usage and real world interfacing.
* Avoid cables and breadboards and try to fit a standardised form factor. In this case a plugable "faceplate" for the exiting gpio port. The board should avoid constraining any existing ports and access.
* Ideally, provide onboard visual feedback to aid learning.
* Avoid additional hardware processing on the add on board. Keeping access to the low level hardware prevents adding more complications when learning. I.e. GALs, additional controller ICs are to be avoided.
